<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Prajin Patil, a second-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student with a growing passion for web development.
   While my academic focus lies in engineering, I’ve developed a keen interest in coding, design, and the endless possibilities the web offers. Through my projects, I strive to bridge the gap between my technical background and creative pursuits, combining problem-solving skills with front-end and back-end web technologies. In this portfolio, you’ll find a collection of my web development projects that reflect my journey and learning in this dynamic field. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and take on new challenges as I progress in both engineering and web development.</p>
